# Credit-Scoring-Model
Delinquency Predictor: Credit Scoring Model Project


The goal is to build a credit scoring model that can predict serious delinquency based on the data of 10,000 borrowers. The data is contained in the 'Credit data.xlsx' dataset and includes various variables such as borrower characteristics, payment history, and financial information. By building a credit scoring model, the lender can use this model to assess the risk of serious delinquency for new borrowers and make informed lending decisions. The model will be trained and evaluated using the data from the 'Credit data.xlsx' dataset, and the performance of the model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics.
